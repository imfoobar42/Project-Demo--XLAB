   - The parent provides a verbal prompt by instructing the child to ""pick one"" and ""make a choice,"" which aligns with the mand-model strategy (+1).
   - There is no clear indication of joint attention being established before or during the prompts, as the transcript does not provide context for visual or shared focus (+0).
   - The transcript does not indicate any waiting period of ~3 seconds for the child's response before the parent continues speaking (+0).

   - The parent presents a verbal prompt in the form of a question: ""What's that man doing?"" (+1 point).
   - The transcript does not provide explicit evidence of joint attention being established before or while prompting, so no point is awarded for joint attention.
   - The parent does not wait ~3 seconds for the child's response before continuing, as the response follows immediately after the prompt. Therefore, no point is awarded for waiting.
   - The parent provides verbal feedback: ""Yeah, he's sleeping,"" which is not a simple ""Yes/No"" question. (+1 point).
